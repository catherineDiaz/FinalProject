This project is an expansion of the Movie Tree assignment. We will be adding things such as genres, actors, descriptions, recommendations. The plan is to add a system of recommendations through use of genres. The approach to this will be the user stating that they like a movie, and then all other movies with the same genre would be recommended. A save file could also be incorporated into this system, where the username is stored, and with each username would be kept the genres that they like.
